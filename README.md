# pyfing - Fingerprint recognition in Python

pyfing provides simple but effective methods for fingerprint recognition.

## Fingerprint segmentation methods
- GMFS (Gradient-Magnitude Fingerprint Segmentation): straightforward yet effective approach, achieving superior performance compared to previously reported traditional (non deep-learning-based) methods. Its average error rate on the FVC segmentation benchmark [1] is 2.98%.
- SUFS (Simplified U-net Fingerprint Segmentation): method based on a simplified U-net architecture that surpasses all previous methods evaluated on the FVC segmentation benchmark [1]. Its average error rate on the benchmark is 1.51%.
